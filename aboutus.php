    We are a small team of undergraduate students with high aims and ambitions.
     We have members with expertise in different fields and have been completing projects on different platforms for some time now. The idea of a side business along with the continuity of our studies had been coming to our minds and we decided to give our thoughts a proper vision and perspective.
     <br>
    Our two co-founders, Asim Manzoor and Muhammad Hamza Awan, were the main architects of this vision. They discussed the company’s main schema and implemented it without any hesitation. The main goal is to create our own products as well as complete any projects coming our way as a private freelance service in which we guarantee reliability and customer satisfaction.
    <br>
    The name of our company, “Revolta”, comes from Galician, an Indo-European language. In Galician, “revolta” means uprising. We decided on this name because we aim to rise as a private company and make a name for ourselves in the tech market on an international level.
